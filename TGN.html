  <h3>About us</h3>
  <h4>What We Do</h4>
  <p>We connect established distributors in need of resources, such as homeless shelters or certain churches, to individuals, organizations,
  and companies that want to and have the resources to help! Our goals are based on improving accessibility and the allocation of resources.
  New York has people that want to help and people that are in need, we create an effective way to connect them. By registering, you are
  becoming part of a network in which everyone is dedicated to helping the homeless of New York. Donors and resource centers that are
  registered with the site are connected based on location and resources and services that can be provided or are needed. By establishing
  these connections, we hope initiate and foster relationships between resource centers and donors that will ultimately optimize the efficiency
  and power that giving resources can have, affecting the quality of life of people in need across all five boroughs.</p>
  <h4>Who We Are</h4>
  <p>The Giving NYC is the brainchild of the Girls Who Code summer immersion program participants. Using our new knowledge of coding and our desire
  to effect change in our community, we came up with the concept of The Giving NYC. The idea is to create systematic change to the way that people
  serve the homeless; creating a network will improve the efficiency, accessibility, and utility of donated resources.</p>
